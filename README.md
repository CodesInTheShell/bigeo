# bigeo
Python based software developed for automated geospatial processing.

Bigeo is a python based software developed for automated geospatial processing.
Bigeo comes along with automated processing algorithms that can be run via command line.
See documentation bigeo HOW TOs

Bigeo can also be imported as a third party library.
Refer to bigeo library documentation.


Bigeo HOW TO’s
=========================

Set Up
------------------------

Setting up the requirements. It is advisable to create your own virtual environments. With in that env, install the dependencies.

pip install fiona
pip install shapely

Reprojecting All files in a directory
Reprojecting all shapefiles on a given directory.

Syntax:

>>>python “/path_to/bigeo.py” projector –indir “/path_to/input_dir” outdir “/path_to/output_dir” --crs “crs_to_use”

Example:

>>>python “bigeo.py” projector –indir “/home/com/Documents/oldshp” --outdir “/home/com/Documents/newshp” --crs “'EPSG:4326'”


Bounding Box
------------------------
Creates a bounding box of a polygon.

Bounding boxes will have the attributes of their respective pylogons.

Syntax:

>>>python “/path_to/bigeo.py” boundingbox –srcfile “/path_to/polygon.shp” --outfile  “/path_to/output.shp” 

Example:

>>>python “bigeo.py” boundingbox –srcfile “countries_polygon.shp” --outfile  “bound_countries.shp” 


Centroids
------------------------
Creates a point on the center of a polygon.

Points will have the attributes of their respective pylogons.

Syntax:

>>>python “/path_to/bigeo.py” centroid –srcfile “/path_to/polygon.shp” --outfile  “/path_to/centroid.shp” 

Example:

>>>python “bigeo.py” boundingbox –srcfile “countries_polygon.shp” --outfile  “bound_countries.shp” 


Representative Point
------------------------
Creates a point guaranteed to be within a polygon.

Syntax:

>>>python “/path_to/bigeo.py” centroid –srcfile “/path_to/polygon.shp” --outfile  “/path_to/reppoint.shp” 

Example:

>>>python “bigeo.py” boundingbox –srcfile “countries_polygon.shp” --outfile  “rep_point_countries.shp”
